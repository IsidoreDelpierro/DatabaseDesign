TOOLS
=====


1) Download MS SQL Server from here 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads 
From the options given, select "SQL Server on-premises" 
NB: Install it using all default settings. This is not best practice, but it is what we need for this demo (it's part of the bad practices I talked about, the ones we are here to resolve).

2) Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from here 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms#download-ssms 
Install it as well
